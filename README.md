# recursive_descent_parser
This is the part 2 of Compiler Project.

SPECIFICATION: This project is to use the grammar definition in the appendix of your text to guide the construction of a recursive descent parser. The parser should follow the grammar as described in A.2 page 492. 
You should enhance the grammar to include FLOAT as appropriate throughout all the grammar rules. 
Upon execution, your project should report  
ACCEPT 
or  
REJECT 
exactly. 
Failure to print ACCEPT or REJECT appropriately will result penalty for the test file.
